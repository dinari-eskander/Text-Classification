# CNN-Based Text Classification

This repository contains a project for classifying text using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow's Keras. The project uses various NLP preprocessing techniques to prepare text data, followed by training a CNN to identify patterns and categorize text into predefined classes.

## Project Overview

This project involves:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Converting text into tokenized sequences and padding them to uniform length, a common practice in NLP.
- **Model Architecture**: A CNN designed for extracting features from sequences of text data.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are used to evaluate model performance.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, use:
